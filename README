## hey, these are the commands I used to compile these objects on 2004-01-09

g++ -I/usr/local/mysql-standard-4.0.12-pc-linux-i686/include -O -pipe -o mysqllevenshtein.so -shared -L/usr/local/mysql-standard-4.0.12-pc-linux-i686/lib -lmysqlclient mysqllevenshtein.cc

## actually, I originally used gcc, but when I tried to load the functions
## into MySQL, I got some undefined symbol errors.  after some googling,
## I thought I'd try g++ to force c++ linking... it worked

## also, come to find out that ldconfig ignores filenames in "untrusted"
## (which means "not /lib or /usr/lib", I think) directories if they don't
## begin with "lib".  so, I had to rename the .so files to libwhatever.so
